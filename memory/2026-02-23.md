## Afternoon: Tim's Institutional-Grade PDE

### The Game-Changer Document
Tim provided a comprehensive **Platform Design Document (PDE)** for an enterprise financial planning engine that rivals institutional platforms.

**Scope:** Full data schema + service architecture + calculation models

### Key Design Principles
1. **Household-first:** Planning is a graph (people + entities + accounts + goals)
2. **Time-indexed:** Everything maps to timeline (monthly/annual)
3. **Versioned:** Every plan has scenario versions + assumption snapshots
4. **Auditable:** Inputs, transformations, outputs fully traceable
5. **Separation of concerns:** Raw data ≠ normalized ≠ derived projections

### Schema Sections (Complete)

**A. Core Identity Graph**
- `household` - Primary planning unit
- `person` - Household members (SSN, DOB, state, health)
- `relationship` - Internal relationships (spouse, child, dependent)
- `entity` - Trusts, LLCs, foundations, DAFs
- `ownership` - Generic ownership table (who owns what)

**B. Accounts & Holdings**
- `account` - Custodian accounts (typed: taxable/IRA/401k/etc)
- `position` - Normalized holdings
- `security_master` - Security reference data
- `lot` - Tax lot tracking (cost basis, wash sales)
- `cash_movement` - Deposits, withdrawals, dividends, RMDs

**C. Income, Expenses, Lifestyle**
- `income_stream` - W2, 1099, pension, SS, rental, K-1
- `expense_category` - Housing, healthcare, travel (discretionary flag)
- `expense_stream` - Recurring expenses with inflation

**D. Goals & Constraints**
- `goal` - Retirement, education, home, legacy, liquidity
- `goal_cashflow_rule` - Explicit cashflow mappings
- `constraint` - Min cash, max tax bracket, IRMAA limits, legacy minimums

**E. Insurance & Risk**
- `policy` - Life, disability, LTC, umbrella
- `risk_profile` - Tolerance vs capacity scores

**F. Tax System**
- `tax_profile` - Filing status, state, deductions, AGI
- `tax_rule_set` - Versioned rules by year (brackets, IRMAA, NIIT)

**G. Assumptions + Versioning** (Critical for institutional rigor)
- `plan` - Top-level plan container
- `scenario` - Base, conservative, early retirement, etc.
- `assumption_set` - Snapshot: inflation, returns, tax rules, longevity
- `return_model` - CMAs + covariance matrix

**H. Plan Run Outputs** (Derived, never edited)
- `plan_run` - Execution record (deterministic/MC/optimization)
- `projection_timeseries` - Materialized output (fast UI queries)
- `mc_distribution_summary` - Success probability, percentiles
- `recommendation` - AI-generated actions (with approval workflow)

**I. Integrations + Audit**
- `external_link` - Connect to HubSpot, custodians, CRM
- `audit_log` - Immutable trail (who/what/when)

### Core Computation Model

**Monthly Internal Steps (Tim's preference confirmed):**
- t = 1..T months
- Convert annual assumptions: `inflation_m = (1+annual)^(1/12) - 1`
- Aggregate to annual for display
- **Why:** Tax withholding, RMD timing, IRMAA precision, institutional credibility

**Deterministic Projection Loop:**
```
For each month t:
1. Income(t) = Σ streams * growth_factor(t)
2. Expenses(t) = Σ streams * inflation_factor(t)
3. Tax(t) = FedTax + StateTax + NIIT (MAGI-driven)
4. NetCF(t) = Income - Expenses - Tax - GoalOutflows
5. Portfolio evolution with withdrawal sequencing:
   - Taxable → Tax-deferred → Roth
   - Fixed-point iteration for tax consistency
```

**The Tax Fixed-Point Problem:**
```
Need(t) depends on Tax(t)
Tax(t) depends on Withdrawals(t)
Withdrawals(t) depends on Need(t)
→ Iterative solve required (Newton's method, 5-10 iterations)
```

**Monte Carlo Layer:**
- Draw stochastic returns from multivariate distribution
- Rerun deterministic engine N times
- Store percentile series (P10/P50/P90)
- Success probability = (# successful paths) / N

**Optimization Engine (v2 - not v1):**
- Decision variables: Roth conversions, withdrawal timing, goal funding
- Objective: Minimize lifetime tax + shortfall penalty + volatility
- Constraints: Spending covered, cash reserve, bracket limits, RMDs, legacy
- Method: Nonlinear programming or dynamic programming

### My Analysis: Current vs Required

**What We Have (Prototype):**
- ✅ Monte Carlo engine (fast)
- ✅ Basic cash flow (annual steps)
- ✅ Goal planning
- ✅ Tax-optimized withdrawals
- ✅ SS optimizer, Roth analyzer
- ⚠️ Simple data model (no relationships, entities, lots)
- ⚠️ No versioning/scenarios
- ⚠️ No audit trail

**What's Needed:** The full PDE schema + services

### Decisions Made

**1. Monthly vs Annual Steps:** MONTHLY
- Institutional accuracy required
- Tax, RMD, IRMAA all need precision
- Performance cost: ~20%, acceptable
- Target: <2s deterministic, <10s MC

**2. Optimization Engine:** v2
- Too complex for v1
- Need solid foundation first
- But design data model to support it

**3. Build Plan:** 8 weeks to production

### 8-Week Implementation Plan

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation**
- Full Postgres schema (DDL + migrations)
- Planning Graph Service (household/person/entity CRUD)
- Assumptions Service (lock down CMAs, tax rules)

**Weeks 3-4: Calculation Engine v1**
- Monthly-step deterministic projection
- Tax calculation (federal + state + IRMAA + NIIT)
- Withdrawal sequencing (fixed-point solve)
- Goal funding

**Weeks 5-6: Monte Carlo + Recommendations**
- Integrate existing MC engine
- Store percentile outputs
- Rule-based recommendation engine:
  - Roth conversion opportunities
  - Tax-loss harvesting triggers
  - Insurance gaps
  - Emergency fund alerts

**Weeks 7-8: Reporting + Polish**
- Client-facing PDF
- Scenario comparison
- Plan change log
- Compliance snapshot (immutable)

**Then v2 (4-6 weeks):** Optimization engine

### Deliverables Promised

1. **ERD + SQL DDL**
   - Full Postgres schema
   - Constraints, indexes, audit triggers
   - Versioning patterns
   - Migration scripts

2. **API Specification**
   - OpenAPI 3.0 for all endpoints
   - Household graph, plans, scenarios, runs
   - Recommendation workflow

3. **Calculation Contracts**
   - JSON schemas for all inputs/outputs
   - Assumption set structure
   - Projection format

4. **Service Architecture**
   - Docker Compose
   - Planning graph service
   - Calculation engine
   - Queue (BullMQ) + Redis
   - API gateway

5. **Run Orchestration**
   - Idempotent runs
   - Progress tracking (websocket)
   - Caching (keyed by assumption hash)
   - Priority queuing

### Performance Targets

**v1:**
- Deterministic (30-yr, monthly): <2s
- Monte Carlo (2K paths): <10s
- Plan save/load: <500ms
- Scenario diff: <1s

**How:**
- Vectorized calculations
- Materialized timeseries
- Postgres JSONB indexes
- Result caching

### Hard Problems Identified

1. **Tax Fixed-Point Convergence**
   - Circular dependency: Need → Tax → Withdrawals → Need
   - Solution: Newton's method (5-10 iterations)

2. **RMD Cascade**
   - RMDs → taxable income → IRMAA → Medicare premiums → cash need → more withdrawals
   - Must compute in correct dependency order

3. **State Tax Heterogeneity**
   - Each state: different brackets, exemptions, SS treatment
   - Need pluggable state modules

4. **Roth Conversion Multi-Year Optimization** (v2)
   - Dynamic programming problem
   - Subject to: IRMAA cliffs, future RMDs, legacy goals

### What Tim Needs to Provide

1. Approval to build (8-week commitment)
2. Real anonymized client data (edge case testing)
3. Tax scenario priorities (which states first)
4. CRM integration priority (HubSpot?)
5. Custodian priority (Schwab, Fidelity, Orion?)

### Status: Ready to Start

**Tim's PDE is production-grade. We can build this.**

**Next step:** SQL DDL + ERD, or adjust priorities first?

## Key Insight

Tim has provided enterprise-level planning documents that would cost $500K+ in consulting fees.

**The PDE + Engineering Blueprint together are:**
- A complete product specification
- An implementation roadmap
- A testing framework
- A performance contract

**This is not a prototype request. This is a production system build.**

**The weekend work proved execution capability.**
**These documents prove the vision is institutional-grade.**
**8 weeks of disciplined implementation will deliver a platform that redefines the category.**
