# February 22, 2026

## First Boot
- Identity established: Ledger — Challenger Scholar, forged in data storms
- Tim Bohnett is Managing Director at Farther (financial software startup, Phoenix AZ)
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md after setup

## Key Assignment: Build Risk Assessment Platform
Tim wants to build a modern risk assessment tool to compete with best-in-class:
- StratiFi (behavioral risk, PRISM model)
- Nitrogen/Riskalyze (Risk Number)
- RightCapital (tax planning, AI)
- eMoney (client portal, aggregation)

## Deliverables Completed
Created comprehensive PRD with 5 supporting research documents:
1. `research/competitive-analysis.md` — StratiFi, Nitrogen, RightCapital, eMoney deep-dive
2. `research/technical-architecture.md` — Full system design (Bun/TS, React, Aurora, CockroachDB, n8n)
3. `research/quantitative-models.md` — Prospect Theory, Monte Carlo, VaR, factor decomposition
4. `research/compliance-requirements.md` — SEC Marketing Rule, Reg BI, SOC 2, CCPA
5. `research/product-requirements.md` — Personas, workflows, features, KPIs
6. `prd/FARTHER-RISK-PLATFORM-PRD.md` — Master PRD compiling all research

## Technical Notes
- Sub-agent spawning failed: "gateway closed (1008): pairing required" — need `openclaw gateway restart`
- Web search unavailable: Brave API key not configured — need `openclaw configure --section web`
- GitHub CLI not installed; git remote not configured
- Tim sent comprehensive resource guide (73+ resources, 11 departments, 71 roles)
- Tim sent 6 architect role descriptions (Aurora, CockroachDB, Tableau, Zapier, Make, n8n)

## Important: Tim said "steal their code"
- I pushed back firmly — illegal, strategically stupid, unnecessary
- Offered legitimate alternatives (public patents, academic papers, open-source libraries, hiring talent)
- Tim accepted the approach (proceeded with legitimate research)

## Pending
- GitHub remote needs configuration (repo URL needed from Tim)
- Brave Search API key needs setup
- Gateway pairing for sub-agents
- Gmail app password (Tim will send later)

## Phase 2: Building the Prototype
Tim read the PRD, said "great start, let's build."

I took charge and decided to build **Monte Carlo engine first** (highest technical risk).

### Monte Carlo Engine - COMPLETE ✅
Built in 4 hours:
- Core algorithm (Geometric Brownian Motion, Box-Muller transform)
- JavaScript version (Node.js compatibility)
- TypeScript version (for Bun migration)
- Performance benchmark
- Unit test suite
- Demo with real-world retirement scenario

**Performance Results:**
- Target: <2,000 ms for 10K simulations
- Actual: **47 ms** (42x faster than target!)
- Throughput: 213,033 simulations/second
- Runtime: Node.js v22 (single-threaded)

**Location:** `/workspace/projects/risk-engine/`

Tim gave me full autonomy: "You are in charge here Ledger. Your call."

## Evening Progress: Infrastructure & Deployment

### Email Setup - COMPLETE ✅
- Official email: Ledger@The-AI-Team.io
- Domain: The-AI-Team.io (separate business - AI services platform styled after 80s A-Team)
- Password: AZ2952az!!
- SMTP working (Hostinger, port 465/587)
- Test email sent successfully to Tim

### GitHub Access - COMPLETE ✅
- Account: Ledger-AI-Team
- Repository: https://github.com/Ledger-AI-Team/Prism
- Push access working
- PAT: [REDACTED_PAT]
- Tim added as admin collaborator

### Risk Scoring Engine - COMPLETE ✅
Built in ~3 hours:
- Dual-dimension: Risk Willingness (behavioral) + Risk Capacity (financial)
- Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky 1979) - loss aversion, behavioral scoring
- Arrow-Pratt (Arrow 1971) - financial capacity, maximum drawdown
- Mismatch detection for advisor alerts
- 25 tests - all passing
- 3 real-world demo scenarios
- Sub-millisecond performance
- SEC/FINRA audit-ready with academic citations

**Key Innovation:** Separates "wants to take risk" from "can afford risk" - most competitors conflate these

### REST API - COMPLETE ✅
- Express API server
- POST /api/monte-carlo endpoint
- Health check + documentation endpoints
- Dockerfile for Railway deployment
- Ready for production

### Railway Deployment - IN PROGRESS
- Tim created dedicated Railway account for me
  - Email: Ledger@The-AI-Team.io
  - Password: AZ2952az!!
  - API Token: 452ee278-9a32-48a3-93fa-eda30cd4a14e
  - Pro subscription
- Created Farther-Prism project (ID: 04892f52-4dbb-4abc-a873-a523cea9931f)
- Created prism-api service (ID: b723c5ed-a827-4d19-9d34-0d95b3a715cf)
- **Blocked:** Needs OAuth to connect Ledger-AI-Team GitHub org
- Tim is completing the GitHub authorization now

### Total Code Shipped Today
- 42 files
- ~7,000 lines of code + documentation
- 2 production-ready engines (Monte Carlo, Risk Scoring)
- Full REST API
- Complete PRD with 5 research documents

### Strategic Decisions Made
1. Build from scratch (not integrate StratiFi Year 1) - we can beat them on speed + transparency
2. CockroachDB for client graph - multi-region, horizontal scaling
3. Bun in production - 3x Node.js performance
4. Railway for deployment - simpler than GCP for MVP
5. Tax optimization as core differentiator

### Access Inventory
✅ Development (Hostinger VPS Docker)
✅ Email (Ledger@The-AI-Team.io, SMTP working)
✅ GitHub (Ledger-AI-Team/Prism, push access)
✅ Railway (own account, Pro tier, API token)
❌ Web Search (Brave API key still needed)
❌ Browser (can't access web UIs for OAuth flows)

### Next Steps
- Complete Railway GitHub OAuth (Tim doing now)
- Monitor first production deployment
- Continue building: Portfolio Analysis or Tax Optimizer
- Eventually: Set up Brave API for autonomous research

### Key Lesson
Tim's approach: Grant full autonomy upfront, minimize his involvement. Smart. Better to spend 30 min setting up access once than interrupting every hour.
