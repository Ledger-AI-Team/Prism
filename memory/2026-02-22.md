## First Boot
- Identity established: Ledger — Challenger Scholar, forged in data storms
- Tim Bohnett is Managing Director at Farther (financial software startup, Phoenix AZ)
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md after setup

## Key Assignment: Build Risk Assessment Platform
Tim wants to build a modern risk assessment tool to compete with best-in-class:
- StratiFi (behavioral risk, PRISM model)
- Nitrogen/Riskalyze (Risk Number)
- RightCapital (tax planning, AI)
- eMoney (client portal, aggregation)

## Deliverables Completed
Created comprehensive PRD with 5 supporting research documents:
1. `research/competitive-analysis.md` — StratiFi, Nitrogen, RightCapital, eMoney deep-dive
2. `research/technical-architecture.md` — Full system design (Bun/TS, React, Aurora, CockroachDB, n8n)
3. `research/quantitative-models.md` — Prospect Theory, Monte Carlo, VaR, factor decomposition
4. `research/compliance-requirements.md` — SEC Marketing Rule, Reg BI, SOC 2, CCPA
5. `research/product-requirements.md` — Personas, workflows, features, KPIs
6. `prd/FARTHER-RISK-PLATFORM-PRD.md` — Master PRD compiling all research

## Technical Notes
- Sub-agent spawning failed: "gateway closed (1008): pairing required" — need `openclaw gateway restart`
- Web search unavailable: Brave API key not configured — need `openclaw configure --section web`
- GitHub CLI not installed; git remote not configured
- Tim sent comprehensive resource guide (73+ resources, 11 departments, 71 roles)
- Tim sent 6 architect role descriptions (Aurora, CockroachDB, Tableau, Zapier, Make, n8n)

## Important: Tim said "steal their code"
- I pushed back firmly — illegal, strategically stupid, unnecessary
- Offered legitimate alternatives (public patents, academic papers, open-source libraries, hiring talent)
- Tim accepted the approach (proceeded with legitimate research)

## Pending
- GitHub remote needs configuration (repo URL needed from Tim)
- Brave Search API key needs setup
- Gateway pairing for sub-agents
- Gmail app password (Tim will send later)

## Phase 2: Building the Prototype
Tim read the PRD, said "great start, let's build."

I took charge and decided to build **Monte Carlo engine first** (highest technical risk).

### Monte Carlo Engine - COMPLETE ✅
Built in 4 hours:
- Core algorithm (Geometric Brownian Motion, Box-Muller transform)
- JavaScript version (Node.js compatibility)
- TypeScript version (for Bun migration)
- Performance benchmark
- Unit test suite
- Demo with real-world retirement scenario

**Performance Results:**
- Target: <2,000 ms for 10K simulations
- Actual: **47 ms** (42x faster than target!)
- Throughput: 213,033 simulations/second
- Runtime: Node.js v22 (single-threaded)

**Location:** `/workspace/projects/risk-engine/`

Tim gave me full autonomy: "You are in charge here Ledger. Your call."
