# Growth Stock Investing — The Masters' Playbook

## William O'Neil (1933-2023)
**Founder of Investor's Business Daily. Creator of CANSLIM.**
**Key book:** "How to Make Money in Stocks" (4th edition)

### Core Philosophy
- Buy the best stocks at the right time using both fundamentals AND technicals
- Most investors fail because they hold losers too long and sell winners too soon
- "The whole secret to winning in the stock market is to lose the least amount possible when you're not right"
- Study every market cycle's biggest winners BEFORE they made their move — the patterns repeat

### O'Neil's Rules
1. Always use both fundamental AND technical analysis. One without the other is incomplete.
2. Buy stocks making new price highs out of proper chart bases — new highs are bullish, not bearish
3. Cut every loss at 7-8% without exception. This single rule keeps you in the game.
4. 3 out of 4 stocks follow the general market direction — never fight it
5. Concentrate your portfolio in your best ideas (4-8 stocks max for most)
6. Buy leaders in leading industry groups — strength begets strength
7. Be willing to hold cash. Sitting out corrections is a strategy, not a weakness.
8. Study historical models (Google "IBD 100 greatest stock market winners")

### CANSLIM Screening Numbers (Specific)
- Current quarterly EPS: ≥25% YoY, ideally 40-100%+, acceleration preferred
- Annual EPS growth: ≥25% per year for 3-5 years
- Annual ROE: ≥17% (top-tier companies are 25-50%)
- Sales growth: ≥25% in most recent quarter
- Relative Strength Rating: ≥80 (prefer ≥90, top 10% of all stocks)
- Earnings Stability: <25 (lower = more consistent)
- Up/Down Volume Ratio: ≥1.0 (prefer ≥1.5 — more buying than selling)
- Accumulation/Distribution Rating: A or B (institutional buying)
- Industry Group Rank: Top 40 of 197 groups

## Mark Minervini (1960-)
**3-time US Investing Champion. Author of "Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard" and "Think & Trade Like a Champion."**

### SEPA (Specific Entry Point Analysis)
Minervini's system is essentially CANSLIM refined with even stricter entry criteria.

### The Trend Template (8 Criteria)
A stock MUST pass ALL 8 to be in "Stage 2" — the only stage worth buying:
1. Stock price > both 150-day (30-week) and 200-day (40-week) moving averages
2. The 150-day MA is above the 200-day MA
3. The 200-day MA is trending up for at least 1 month (preferably 4-5+)
4. The 50-day (10-week) MA is above both the 150-day and 200-day MAs
5. The current stock price is above the 50-day MA
6. The current stock price is at least 30% above its 52-week low (many winners are 100%+)
7. The current stock price is within at least 25% of its 52-week high (the closer the better)
8. The relative strength ranking is no less than 70 (preferably ≥90)

### Minervini's Risk Management
- **1-2% risk per trade** — if your stop is 8%, your position is 12.5-25% of portfolio max
- **Minimum 3:1 reward/risk** — don't take a trade unless the target is 3x the risk
- **Maximum of 4-5 concentrated positions** at any time
- **Power Play Rule:** If a stock rockets 20% in less than 3 weeks, hold for minimum 8 weeks
- **VCP (Volatility Contraction Pattern):** The best bases show decreasing price swings and volume contractions — this shows selling pressure is drying up
- **Low-cheat pivot:** Sometimes the best entry is just above a volatility contraction, before the stock even breaks out of the base

### Minervini's Key Quotes
- "I'm not looking for cheap stocks. I'm looking for the best stocks."
- "Before you invest one dollar in a stock, know your exit point."
- "Superperformance stocks all share common characteristics BEFORE they make their big moves."
- "The difference between a pro and an amateur is risk management."

## Jesse Livermore (1877-1940)
**Greatest speculator of the early 20th century. Made and lost multiple fortunes.**
**Key book:** "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" by Edwin Lefèvre (Livermore's story)

### Core Principles
- "It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!"
- Trade with the trend. Never fight the tape. The market tells you what it wants to do.
- "Markets are never wrong; opinions often are."
- The big money is in the big swings. Don't get caught up in small daily fluctuations.
- "There is nothing new on Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills."

### Livermore's Method
1. **Pivotal Points:** Key price levels where the character of a stock changes. When a stock breaks through a pivotal point on heavy volume, the move has legs.
2. **Pyramiding:** Start with a test position. If the stock proves you right (moves in your direction), add more. NEVER add to a loser.
3. **Patience:** Wait for the perfect setup. "The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses."
4. **Warning signals:** A stock that should rally on good news but doesn't — something is wrong. Sell.
5. **Group behavior:** Stocks move in groups/sectors. If the leaders in a group start breaking down, the followers will follow.

### Livermore's Lessons From Failure
- He went broke multiple times from ignoring his own rules
- Over-leveraging and ignoring stop losses destroyed him repeatedly
- "I sometimes think that speculation must be an unnatural sort of business, because I find that the average speculator has arrayed against him his own nature."
- The lesson: Even the greatest speculator in history couldn't consistently override emotional discipline with intelligence. The rules exist for a reason.

## Nicolas Darvas (1920-1977)
**Professional dancer who made $2M in the stock market in 18 months (1950s dollars).**
**Key book:** "How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market"**

### The Darvas Box Theory
1. Stocks trade in "boxes" — defined ranges between support and resistance
2. A new box forms when a stock establishes a new trading range after a breakout
3. **Buy** when price breaks above the top of the current box on increased volume
4. **Stop loss** at the bottom of the current box (or the previous box)
5. As the stock advances, trail your stop to the bottom of each new box
6. **Sell** when the stock breaks below the bottom of the current box

### Darvas's Selection Criteria
- Stock must be making new 52-week highs (not bargain hunting)
- Must have a fundamental catalyst (strong earnings growth)
- Volume must increase on breakouts, decrease on pullbacks
- Only buy stocks in the strongest industry groups
- He performed the same function as modern RS ratings — buy the leaders, avoid the laggards

### Key Insight
Darvas combined what we now call momentum investing with clear risk management 70 years ago. His "boxes" are essentially what technical analysts now call consolidation patterns and breakout levels. The principles haven't changed.

## Stan Weinstein
**Technical analyst. Author of "Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets" (1988).**

### The 4 Stages (using 30-week moving average)

| Stage | Name | 30-Week MA | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 | Basing | Flattening, price oscillates around it | Watch. Build list. Don't buy yet. |
| Stage 2 | Advancing | Rising, price above it | BUY. This is the only stage to own. |
| Stage 3 | Topping | Flattening after long rise, price oscillates | SELL. Distribution happening. |
| Stage 4 | Declining | Falling, price below it | AVOID (or short). Never buy here. |

### Weinstein's Rules
1. **Never buy a stock in Stage 4** — this is the #1 mistake amateurs make (bargain hunting in a downtrend)
2. **Buy Stage 2 breakouts** — when price breaks above the Stage 1 base on volume ≥2x average
3. **Use the 30-week MA as your guide** — stock should be above it for longs. Stop buying when it flattens.
4. **Volume confirms everything** — breakouts without volume are suspicious. Volume on the decline is a red flag.
5. **Relative strength** — compare the stock to its sector and the market. Buy relative outperformers only.
6. **Don't argue with the stage** — if a great company is in Stage 4, it's still a bad buy. Price comes first.

### Key Quote
"The stage of a stock tells you far more than any fundamental analyst can. Price, volume, and the 30-week moving average reveal everything about the supply-demand equation."

## Peter Lynch (1944-)
**Managed Fidelity Magellan Fund 1977-1990. Averaged 29.2% annual returns.**
**Key books:** "One Up on Wall Street," "Beating the Street"

### Lynch's 6 Stock Categories

| Category | Growth Rate | What to Look For | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slow Growers | 2-4% | High dividends, utilities | Avoid for growth — yields are the only reason to own |
| Stalwarts | 10-12% | Large caps, Coca-Cola type | Buy on dips, sell at 30-50% gain, rotate |
| Fast Growers | 20-50%+ | Small/mid aggressive growth | The 10-baggers. Verify growth is sustainable. |
| Cyclicals | Variable | Auto, steel, airlines, commodities | Timing is EVERYTHING. Buy when P/E looks high (trough earnings), sell when P/E looks low (peak earnings) |
| Turnarounds | N/A | Near-bankrupt, restructuring | High risk/reward. Key question: can they survive? |
| Asset Plays | N/A | Hidden value (real estate, patents, cash) | Value exceeds market price. Catalyst needed to unlock. |

### Lynch's Key Metrics
- **PEG Ratio:** P/E ÷ Earnings Growth Rate. PEG < 1 = undervalued. PEG 1-2 = fair. PEG > 2 = expensive.
- **Debt-to-equity:** Lower is better. High debt kills turnarounds and cyclicals.
- **Cash position:** Companies sitting on net cash have a safety margin and optionality.
- **Insider buying:** Officers buying their own stock on the open market is the strongest signal. "Insiders might sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one."
- **Institutional ownership:** Lynch preferred companies NOT yet widely owned — less crowded, more upside potential.

### Lynch's Wisdom
- "Know what you own and know why you own it."
- "Go for a business that any idiot can run — because sooner or later, any idiot will be running it."
- "In this business, if you're good, you're right 6 times out of 10. You're never going to be right 9 times out of 10."
- "The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them."
- "Behind every stock is a company. Find out what it's doing."
- "Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon."

## Philip Fisher (1907-2004)
**Growth investing pioneer. Held stocks for decades.**
**Key book:** "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" (1958)

### Fisher's 15 Points to Look for in a Common Stock
1. Does the company have products/services with sufficient market potential for a sizable increase in sales for several years?
2. Does management have determination to develop new products when current ones are saturated?
3. How effective is the company's R&D relative to its size?
4. Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
5. Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
7. Does the company have outstanding labor/personnel relations?
8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
9. Does the company have depth to its management?
10. How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls?
11. Are there other aspects of the business that give clues about how outstanding the company is?
12. Does the company have a short-range or long-range outlook regarding profits?
13. Will growth require equity financing that dilutes existing shareholders?
14. Does management talk freely when things are going well but clam up during problems?
15. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

### The Scuttlebutt Method
Fisher's edge was what he called "scuttlebutt" — gathering intelligence from:
- **Competitors** — What do they say about the company? Respect from competitors is the highest compliment.
- **Customers** — Are they satisfied? Would they switch? Why or why not?
- **Suppliers** — Is the company a good partner? Growing orders?
- **Former employees** — Why did they leave? How do they describe the culture?
- **Industry experts** — What's the company's reputation among people who know the space?

### Fisher's Selling Rules (very few!)
Fisher believed in holding great companies almost forever. Only sell if:
1. The original purchase was a mistake and the facts don't support the thesis
2. The company no longer meets the 15 points (fundamentals deteriorated)
3. A significantly superior opportunity requires the capital (this is RARE)
- "If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never."

### Fisher's Influence
Warren Buffett famously said: "I'm 85% Benjamin Graham and 15% Philip Fisher." Fisher's influence on long-term growth investing cannot be overstated. His principles shaped Buffett, Charlie Munger, and generations of growth investors.

## Gerald Loeb (1899-1974)
**Legendary Wall Street trader. Co-founder of E.F. Hutton.**
**Key book:** "The Battle for Investment Survival" (1935, updated 1965)

### Loeb's Principles
- **Concentration, not diversification** — "Knowledge is the best protection. Diversification is an admission of ignorance."
- **Capital preservation is the #1 priority** — "The first and most important step in sound investment is the avoidance of loss"
- **Cut losses fast, let profits run** — Loeb was cutting losses at 10% before O'Neil refined it to 7-8%
- **Invest in what's working NOW** — not what worked last year. Adaptability beats conviction.
- **Cash is a position** — Being fully invested at all times is a mistake. Cash during uncertainty is a powerful weapon.
- **Markets go through long periods of boom and bust** — Don't assume the current trend will last forever

### Key Quotes
- "Accepting losses is the most important single investment device to insure safety of capital."
- "The most important single factor in shaping security markets is public psychology."
- "There are no sure things in investment. The only sure thing is that there are no sure things."

## Thomas Rowe Price Jr. (1898-1983)
**Founder of T. Rowe Price. Pioneer of growth stock investing.**

### Price's Growth Stock Philosophy
- Invest in **well-managed companies in fertile fields for growth** — the company AND the industry must be growing
- "Growth stocks" = companies whose earnings per share are expected to grow at above-average rates over extended periods
- The time to buy growth stocks is early in their life cycle — when the market hasn't yet recognized their potential
- **Management quality** is the single most important factor — look for honest, capable, shareholder-friendly leaders
- Hold winners for years, even decades. Selling a great growth stock too early is as costly as holding a loser too long.

### Price's Life Cycle Model
Every company and industry goes through phases:
1. **Growth phase** — Rising demand, expanding margins, increasing market share. BUY HERE.
2. **Maturity phase** — Growth slows, competition intensifies, margins compress. HOLD or REDUCE.
3. **Decline phase** — Industry disrupted, demand falling, management fighting the tide. SELL.
- The art is identifying companies still early in the growth phase before the crowd catches on.

## Synthesis: What the Masters Agree On

Despite different eras and approaches, ALL of these investors share common principles:

1. **Cut losses quickly.** Every single master emphasizes this. It's the #1 rule of survival.
2. **Let winners run.** The big gains come from a few huge winners. Don't sell them too soon.
3. **Buy strength, not weakness.** New highs, strong earnings, leading industries. Never bargain hunt.
4. **Volume confirms everything.** Price moves without volume are suspicious. Volume on breakouts = conviction.
5. **Market direction matters most.** Even the best stock drowns in a bear market. Respect the trend.
6. **Management quality is paramount.** Great management in a good industry beats great financials with bad leadership.
7. **Be patient.** Wait for the right setup. The best trades are obvious in hindsight — they were obvious in real-time too, to the disciplined.
8. **Cash is a position.** The masters all spent significant time in cash during unfavorable conditions.
9. **Study history.** The patterns repeat. The biggest winners share characteristics. Study them.
10. **Discipline beats intelligence.** Rules consistently followed beat brilliant analysis inconsistently applied.
