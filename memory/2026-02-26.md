## Morning Status (06:02 UTC)
- WhatsApp gateway: 2 brief disconnections overnight (auto-reconnected)
- Server: 4d 12h uptime, all healthy
- Recent work: 49 commits (Compass V2, AI Presentation Generator, Focus statement upload)
- Uncommitted: COMPASS-V2-SPEC.md, memory/2026-02-25.md

## Tim's Request (14:50 UTC)
"Research ways to enhance risk questionnaire and final report. Come back with 3 enhancement ideas."

### Brave API Key Configured
Tim provided: BSAPQWJ7BOkzD9VXcRUv_i3SRR0EIDM  
Saved to ~/.openclaw/.env

### Research Completed
**Sources:**
- Orion 3D Risk Tolerance Questionnaire (Dr. Daniel Crosby)
- Nick Carr dissertation (Kansas State): Seven Dimensions of Risk
- Kitces: "9 Questions To Frame Risk Tolerance As A Partnership" (Jan 2026)
- Competitive analysis: FinaMetrica, Riskalyze, StratiFi, Nitrogen, Oxford Risk
- BlackRock Aladdin Scenario Tester (stress testing)
- Behavioral finance: Kahneman (loss aversion), Wilson & Gilbert (affective forecasting)

**Key Insights:**
1. **Traditional tools fail:** "Illusion of clarity" — scores don't predict behavior
2. **Risk is 7-dimensional:** Tolerance, capacity, perception, literacy, **composure**, need, preference (Nick Carr framework)
3. **Composure = behavior predictor:** Orion's innovation — measures anxiety/volatility response (most predictive dimension)
4. **Memory > hypotheticals:** "How did you react in 2008/2020?" beats "How would you react to 20% drop?"
5. **Conversation > questionnaires:** Risk is a story, not a score (Kitces)

**Competitive Gap:**
No one combines:
- 7-dimension profiling
- Behavioral composure scoring
- Real portfolio stress testing
- Conversation-guided intake
- AI-powered adaptive recalibration

### 3 Enhancements Proposed

**Enhancement 1: Behavioral Composure Score™**
- "Panic Predictor" — measure anxiety, not just tolerance
- Memory-based questions (actual 2008/2020 behavior)
- Composure score 0-100 (predict who will panic-sell)
- Tag high-anxiety clients for proactive advisor outreach
- **Edge:** Orion has this, but only for their users. We make it cross-platform.

**Enhancement 2: Portfolio-Risk Alignment Dashboard** ⭐ **PRIORITY #1**
- "Your Risk Number vs Your Real Risk"
- Visual alignment gauge (stated 80/100, actual portfolio 60/100 = gap)
- Stress test matrix (2008, 2020, hypothetical 40% crash with client's holdings)
- Gap analysis with rebalancing suggestions (tax-aware)
- **Edge:** Nitrogen shows numbers. We show consequences + visual storytelling.

**Enhancement 3: Adaptive Risk Profiling Engine**
- Continuous monitoring (life events, market volatility, behavioral signals)
- AI-triggered micro-surveys (contextual, not full re-takes)
- Risk score evolution tracking (drift detection)
- Advisor alerts: "Client composure dropped 18pts — recommend call"
- **Edge:** No one has this. All tools are static annual re-takes.

### Files Created
- `RISK-ENHANCEMENTS-RESEARCH.md` — full competitive analysis, sources, market gaps
- `RISK-ENHANCEMENTS-PROPOSAL.md` — 3 enhancement specs with implementation details

### Recommendation
Start with **Enhancement #2 (Portfolio-Risk Alignment Dashboard)**:
- Highest impact
- Leverages existing Compass + Focus stack
- Perfect for demos/sales
- 4-week build timeline

### Extended Research (14:50-15:00 UTC)
**Tim requested:** Search web for MORE enhancement ideas beyond the base 3

**Research Areas:**
- Client engagement tools, gamification, behavioral nudges
- AI/ML personalization, voice assistants
- Biometric stress monitoring (wearables)
- Predictive churn analytics
- Peer benchmarking (social comparison)
- Video personalization, explainer content
- Interactive client portals

**Key Findings:**
- 75% return rate for gamified financial platforms
- 68% of firms prioritizing AI in risk management (KPMG)
- Wearables track HRV, GSR for stress detection
- 85% of advisors exploring conversational AI (Gartner)
- Churn reduction 15-25% via predictive analytics
- $10T+ assets benchmarked via peer comparison (CWAN)
- 80% video open rate vs 25% for PDF reports

### 7 Additional Enhancements Proposed
4. **Gamified Risk Learning Journey** (badges, streaks, portfolio simulation game)
5. **Biometric Stress Integration** (Apple Watch HRV monitoring, stress-triggered alerts)
6. **Voice AI Risk Assistant** (Alexa-style conversational interface)
7. **Predictive Client Churn Engine** (ML-powered early warning system)
8. **Social Peer Benchmarking** (anonymous performance comparison)
9. **AI-Generated Video Reports** (auto-generate personalized explainers)
10. **Interactive Risk Playground** (drag-drop asset allocation + live stress testing)

### Prioritization
**Immediate wins:**
- #10 Interactive Risk Playground (5 weeks, high impact, leverages existing stack)
- #8 Social Peer Benchmarking (3 weeks, social proof + engagement)

**High ROI:**
- #7 Predictive Churn Engine (15-25% churn reduction)
- #4 Gamified Learning (75% return rate)

**Cutting-edge differentiation:**
- #5 Biometric Stress (no one has this, R&D phase)
- #10 Real-time stress testing (MoneyGuidePro is static)

### Files Created
- `RISK-ENHANCEMENTS-ADVANCED.md` — 7 additional enhancement specs with implementation details

## Status
Waiting for Tim to pick 2-3 enhancements for immediate build.
