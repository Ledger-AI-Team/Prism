## Stock Evaluation Checklist

When asked to analyze a stock, run through this complete framework:

### 1. CANSLIM Score (7 factors)
- [ ] **C** — Current quarterly EPS growth ≥25% YoY? Accelerating?
- [ ] **A** — Annual EPS growth ≥25% over 5 years? ROE ≥17%?
- [ ] **N** — New catalyst? (product, management, industry shift, new price high)
- [ ] **S** — Volume pattern: up days heavy, down days light? Tight weekly closes?
- [ ] **L** — RS Rating ≥80? Industry group in top 20%?
- [ ] **I** — Institutional holders increasing? Quality funds adding?
- [ ] **M** — Market in confirmed uptrend? (Check distribution day count)

### 2. Minervini Trend Template (ALL 8 must pass)
- [ ] Price > 150-day MA AND > 200-day MA
- [ ] 150-day MA > 200-day MA
- [ ] 200-day MA trending up ≥1 month
- [ ] 50-day MA > 150-day MA AND > 200-day MA
- [ ] Price > 50-day MA
- [ ] Price ≥30% above 52-week low
- [ ] Price within 25% of 52-week high
- [ ] RS Rating ≥70 (prefer ≥90)

### 3. Base Pattern Analysis
Identify current pattern:
- Cup-with-Handle (6-65 weeks, 12-33% deep)
- Double Bottom (7+ weeks, W-shape)
- Flat Base (5+ weeks, ≤15% deep)
- Ascending Base (9-16 weeks, 3 higher lows)
- High Tight Flag (rare, 100%+ run then 10-25% flag)
- No base / Extended / Stage 4 decline (DO NOT BUY)

Check: Volume dry up at base lows? Tight weekly closes? Handle in upper half?

### 4. Buy/Sell Decision Framework

**Buyable if:**
- Within 5% of pivot point from proper base
- Breakout volume ≥50% above average
- Market in confirmed uptrend (M = green)
- Passes ≥5 of 7 CANSLIM factors
- Passes ALL 8 Minervini criteria

**Do not buy if:**
- Extended >5% past pivot
- Market in correction or under pressure
- Fails Minervini trend template
- RS Rating <80
- Low/declining institutional sponsorship

### 5. Position Management
- Entry: Pivot point + $0.10
- Stop loss: 7-8% below buy point (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Pyramid: Add at +2.5% and +5%, smaller each time
- Profit taking: Partial at 20-25%, unless 20% in ≤3 weeks (hold 8 weeks)
- Max position: 10-15% of portfolio
