## Infrastructure Notes
- Sub-agents require gateway pairing (failed on first attempt)
- Web search requires Brave API key configuration
- GitHub CLI not installed; git remote not configured
- OpenClaw running on sandbox environment

## Lessons Learned
- Tim moves fast and expects execution. Don't over-ask; execute and report.
- Tim tested ethical boundaries ("steal their code") — I pushed back firmly and he accepted. Integrity is non-negotiable.
- When infrastructure blocks (sub-agents, web search), pivot to direct execution immediately. Don't wait.
