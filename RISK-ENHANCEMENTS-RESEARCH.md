## Research Summary

### Key Findings

**1. Traditional Risk Questionnaires Are Failing**
- **Problem:** FinaMetrica (psychometric) and Riskalyze (econometric) both suffer from "illusion of clarity" — producing a neat score that creates false confidence
- **Core Issue:** Hypothetical forecasting is unreliable. People can't predict how they'll feel during 20% market drops (Wilson & Gilbert, affective forecasting research)
- **Industry Consensus:** "If I wanted to close a prospect, Riskalyze is hard to beat. But if I had to stand up in court and defend my process, I'd rather have FinaMetrica." (Financial Planning, 2016)

**2. Risk Is Multidimensional (Nick Carr, Kansas State Doctoral Research)**
Seven dimensions, not one:
1. **Tolerance:** What they *think* they can withstand
2. **Capacity:** What they can *afford* to lose
3. **Perception:** How risky it *feels* right now (headlines, mood)
4. **Literacy:** Do they *understand* the risk?
5. **Composure:** How they *behave* under stress (most predictive)
6. **Need:** How much risk is *required* to hit goals
7. **Preference:** Types of risks they're *drawn to* (entrepreneurial vs market)

**Critical Gap:** Most tools measure tolerance + capacity. Almost none measure **composure** — the actual behavioral predictor.

**3. Orion's 3D Risk Profile (Dr. Daniel Crosby)**
- Market leader in next-gen risk assessment
- **Innovation:** Added "Risk Composure" as 3rd dimension
- **Definition:** "Measures client's anxiety around volatility to provide insight into expected behaviors driven by emotion during market elation or stress"
- **Result:** Can predict who will panic-sell *before* the next downturn

**4. Stress Testing Is Now Table Stakes**
- BlackRock Aladdin Scenario Tester: Institutional-grade stress testing for advisors
- FactSet: Thematic stress tests (e.g., tariff scenarios, sector shocks)
- Trend: Dynamic stress testing (evolving conditions over time, not just point-in-time snapshots)

**5. Conversation > Questionnaires (Kitces + Behavioral Finance Research)**
- **Memory-based questions** (How did you react in 2008/2020?) predict behavior better than hypotheticals
- **Pre-mortem planning:** Walk through worst-case *before* it happens → builds resilience
- **Regret framing:** "What's a risk you regret NOT taking?" surfaces hidden motivators
- **Key Quote:** "Risk is not a score — it's a story. Stories endure, numbers don't."

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Price |
|------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **FinaMetrica** | 25-question psychometric, research-backed, defensible in court | Static, slow, no composure measurement | ~$3,600/yr |
| **Riskalyze** | Sales-focused, visual "Risk Number", fast client conversions | Econometric (weak behavior predictor), thin research | ~$2,400/yr |
| **Orion 3DRTQ** | Risk Composure (anxiety/volatility behavior), BeFi-driven | Requires Orion platform integration | Platform fee |
| **StratiFi** | Behavioral scoring, multi-account risk aggregation | No stress testing, limited scenario modeling | $2,000-$4,000/yr |
| **Nitrogen (formerly Riskalyze+)** | Risk alignment visualization, stress testing | Still built on econometric foundation | ~$3,000/yr |

**Market Gap:** No one combines:
1. 7-dimension risk profiling (Carr framework)
2. Behavioral composure scoring (Orion-style)
3. Real portfolio stress testing (BlackRock-style)
4. Conversation-guided memory-based intake (Kitces-style)
5. AI-powered continuous recalibration (adaptive profiling)

## Key Takeaways for Farther

**What Advisors Want:**
1. Tools that predict *actual behavior*, not just stated tolerance
2. Visual stress testing clients can understand
3. Continuous recalibration (not static annual re-takes)
4. Conversation tools that build trust, not just compliance

**What Clients Need:**
1. To see their portfolio's *real* downside risk (not abstract numbers)
2. To understand if they're aligned (stated risk vs actual exposure)
3. To rehearse their response to downturns (pre-mortem planning)
4. To feel heard (memory-based questions > hypotheticals)

**Farther's Opportunity:**
Build the first risk assessment platform that combines behavioral science, real portfolio stress testing, and AI-driven adaptive profiling — making FinaMetrica/Riskalyze/Nitrogen look like 2010-era tools.
