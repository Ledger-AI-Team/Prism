Sarah: Thanks for joining me today, John and Mary. I'd love to learn more about your financial situation and goals. Let's start with the basics - what are your ages?

John: I'm 52, and Mary is 50.

Sarah: Great. And can you tell me about your current employment?

John: Sure, I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft. Been there for about 15 years. My base salary is $180,000, and I typically get a bonus of around $40,000 per year.

Mary: And I'm a project manager at Amazon. My salary is $145,000 with about a $25,000 annual bonus.

Sarah: Excellent. Now let's talk about your retirement accounts. What do you have saved so far?

John: I have a 401(k) at Fidelity with about $650,000 in it. I've been maxing out my contributions for years. I also rolled over an old 401(k) into a traditional IRA at Schwab - that has around $220,000.

Mary: I have my 401(k) at Vanguard, currently sitting at $485,000. And I have a Roth IRA at Fidelity with about $85,000.

Sarah: That's great savings! Any other investment accounts?

John: We have a joint brokerage account at Schwab with roughly $300,000. We've been putting extra savings there.

Mary: Oh, and don't forget the 529 accounts for the kids.

John: Right, we have two 529 plans - one for each child. Emily's has about $120,000 and Jake's has $95,000. Both at Vanguard.

Sarah: Perfect. Speaking of the kids, how old are they?

Mary: Emily is 14 and Jake is 11. We're hoping to send them both to good universities.

Sarah: Understood. What about your home?

John: We own our home in Bellevue. We bought it for $800,000 about 8 years ago, but it's probably worth around $1.2 million now with how the market's been.

Mary: We still owe about $320,000 on the mortgage. Our monthly payment is $3,200, and we have about 15 years left.

Sarah: Got it. Any other real estate?

John: Not right now, but we've been thinking about buying a vacation home in the San Juan Islands eventually. Maybe in 5-7 years.

Sarah: Nice goal! Let's talk about expenses. Beyond the mortgage, what are your major monthly expenses?

Mary: Well, our property taxes are about $12,000 per year. Groceries and general living expenses are probably $2,500 per month.

John: Healthcare is covered by our employers for the most part, but we probably spend another $400 per month on co-pays and out-of-pocket stuff.

Mary: The kids' activities - sports, music lessons, tutoring - that's easily $1,500 per month combined.

John: We travel quite a bit. I'd say we spend about $15,000 per year on vacations.

Sarah: What about insurance? Do you have life insurance?

John: I have a $1 million term life policy through Northwestern Mutual. Premium is about $1,200 per year.

Mary: I have $750,000 in coverage, also term, through MetLife. Mine's about $900 per year.

Sarah: Excellent. Now, looking forward - when are you thinking about retirement?

John: Ideally, I'd like to retire at 62. That gives me 10 more years.

Mary: I'm hoping to retire around the same time, maybe 60 or 62.

Sarah: And what kind of lifestyle do you envision in retirement?

Mary: We want to travel more - probably 3-4 big trips per year. Europe, Asia, South America.

John: Yeah, and I want to spend more time on hobbies. I'm really into photography and woodworking. We'd probably need... what do you think, maybe $120,000 per year to live comfortably?

Mary: That sounds about right. Maybe a bit more to account for healthcare.

Sarah: Makes sense. Are you comfortable with investment risk?

John: I'm pretty aggressive right now since we have time. I'd say 80% stocks, 20% bonds in my 401(k).

Mary: I'm a little more conservative - maybe 70/30 stocks to bonds. But I'm okay with some volatility.

Sarah: Great. Last question - do you have an emergency fund?

Mary: We keep about $50,000 in a high-yield savings account at Marcus. We figure that's about 6 months of expenses.

John: Yeah, and we could always tap the brokerage account if we really needed to.

Sarah: Perfect. This gives me a great starting point. Let me put together a comprehensive plan for you both...
